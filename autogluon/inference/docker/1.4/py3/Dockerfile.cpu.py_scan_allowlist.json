    "77714": "A vulnerability in the `preprocess_string()` function of the `transformers.testing_utils` module in huggingface/transformers version v4.48.3 allows for a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. The regular expression used to process code blocks in docstrings contains nested quantifiers, leading to exponential backtracking when processing input with a large number of newline characters. An attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted payload, causing high CPU usage and potential application downtime, effectively resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) scenario.",
    "77985": "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically in the `get_configuration_file()` function within the `transformers.configuration_utils` module. The affected version is 4.49.0, and the issue is resolved in version 4.51.0. The vulnerability arises from the use of a regular expression pattern `config\\.(.*)\\.json` that can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption through crafted input strings, leading to catastrophic backtracking. This can result in model serving disruption, resource exhaustion, and increased latency in applications using the library.",
    "77988": "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically in the `get_imports()` function within `dynamic_module_utils.py`. This vulnerability affects versions 4.49.0 and is fixed in version 4.51.0. The issue arises from a regular expression pattern `\\s*try\\s*:.*?except.*?:` used to filter out try/except blocks from Python code, which can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption through crafted input strings due to catastrophic backtracking. This vulnerability can lead to remote code loading disruption, resource exhaustion in model serving, supply chain attack vectors, and development pipeline disruption.",
    "77990": "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the huggingface/transformers repository, specifically in version 4.49.0. The vulnerability is due to inefficient regular expression complexity in the `SETTING_RE` variable within the `transformers/commands/chat.py` file. The regex contains repetition groups and non-optimized quantifiers, leading to exponential backtracking when processing 'almost matching' payloads. This can degrade application performance and potentially result in a denial-of-service (DoS) when handling specially crafted input strings. The issue is fixed in version 4.51.0.",
    "78153": "A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically within the DonutProcessor class's token2json() method. This vulnerability affects versions 4.51.3 and earlier, and is fixed in version 4.52.1. The issue arises from the regex pattern <s_(.*?)> which can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption through crafted input strings due to catastrophic backtracking. This vulnerability can lead to service disruption, resource exhaustion, and potential API service vulnerabilities, impacting document processing tasks using the Donut model.",
    "77986": "Hugging Face Transformers versions up to 4.49.0 are affected by an improper input validation vulnerability in the `image_utils.py` file. The vulnerability arises from insecure URL validation using the `startswith()` method, which can be bypassed through URL username injection. This allows attackers to craft URLs that appear to be from YouTube but resolve to malicious domains, potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or data exfiltration. The issue is fixed in version 4.52.1."
