# Guideline when creating a documentations website for Deep Learning Containers

When working in `deep-learning-containers` repository under the directory `docs`, you are actively working on writing documentations for AWS Deep Learning Containers.

## Project guideline

Our documentations uses Material for MkDocs lightweight framework for all our static documentations. When working, ensure that we are using industry best practices when organizing the codebase unless there are any specific instructions provided.

Within this documentations page, website navigation through `.nav.yml` file should be in one file at `docs/.nav.yml` unless a developer specify otherwise. This is done so that we have a central place to organize our pages.

## Update knowledge base

If there are any new changes to the documentations generation and organization, make sure to update you knowledge base in the steering/docs.md file.
