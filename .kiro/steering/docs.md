# Guideline when creating a documentations website for Deep Learning Containers

When working in `deep-learning-containers` repository under the directory `docs`, you are actively working on writing documentations for AWS Deep Learning Containers.

Our documentations uses Material for MkDocs lightweight framework for all our static documentations. When working, ensure that we are using industry best practices when organizing the codebase unless there are any specific instructions provided.

Within this documentations page, website navigation through `.nav.yml` file should be in one file at `docs/.nav.yml`. This is done so that we have a central place to organize our pages.
