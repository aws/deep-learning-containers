Anaconda repository subscription

Anaconda repository is sold as an annual subscription. Upon receipt of your annual subscription payment (or monthly installment) you will be provided with access to a private collection of packages containing software and additional material for your use in maintaining and deploying software across your organization and to your customers. You will also obtain access to private collections of supported older versions of Anaconda which may not exist in the free and public repositories. Your rights to access this collection and use or benefit from the materials obtained from that repository end when the subscription terminates. You may continue to use and benefit from all public Anaconda binary packages, however your extended redistribution rights as described below will expire at the end of your subscription term.
Anaconda repository license supplants Anaconda license

With a fully-paid subscription and license to Anaconda repository, this license replaces the Anaconda license for you regardless of how you obtain Anaconda and any packages included in Continuum’s free repositories.
Enhanced Anaconda redistribution rights

Anaconda repository gives you enhanced rights associated with the binaries available in Anaconda which includes Continuum’s freely available binary distribution of Python and also encompasses Continuum’s repository of freely available binary packages for Python. For the purposes of this section, these Anaconda binaries also may include binaries of open-source packages obtained from private collections provided only to Anaconda repository subscribers. This section does not apply to proprietary Anaconda Add-Ons whether from Continuum or Third-Party Vendors.

You may redistribute the Anaconda binary packages you obtain while you have a fully-paid subscription to Anaconda repository. You may redistribute these binaries (“Anaconda-Derived Binaries”) with or without modification, in source or binary form without any further requirement other than those imposed by the individual open-source licenses themselves. However, you cannot extend these same enhanced redistribution rights for the Anaconda binaries to those who receive your Anaconda-Derived Binaries. You may not redistribute any proprietary Anaconda add-ons (“Add-Ons”) or packages obtained via the private Anaconda repository package repository without obtaining a specific license to redistribute the Software Product or the Add-Ons.
Bundled support services

Anaconda repository comes bundled with a fixed number of hours of installation and setup support which can also be used to request additional packages or bug-fixes to Other Vendor Tools. Your requests for packages and support will be honored by Continuum’s best available resources until the agreed-upon number of hours is consumed by the support requests.
Bundled proprietary software

Anaconda repository comes bundled with a limited set of licenses for additional Anaconda Add-Ons from Continuum. This software should only be used under the terms of their respective licenses and only for the number of users included with the quote.
