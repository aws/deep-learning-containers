## AWS Deep Learning Containers

AWS [Deep Learning Containers (DLCs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deep-learning-containers/latest/devguide/what-is-dlc.html) 
are a set of Docker images for training and serving models in TensorFlow, TensorFlow 2, PyTorch, and MXNet. 
Deep Learning Containers provide optimized environments with TensorFlow and MXNet, Nvidia CUDA (for GPU instances), and 
Intel MKL (for CPU instances) libraries and 
are available in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). 

The AWS DLCs are used in Amazon SageMaker as the default vehicles for your SageMaker jobs such as training, inference, 
transforms etc. They've been tested for machine
learning workloads on Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS services as well.

The list of DLC images is maintained [here](available_images.md). 
You can find more information on the images available in Sagemaker [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pre-built-containers-frameworks-deep-learning.html)

### Getting started

We describe here the setup to build and test the DLCs on the platforms Amazon SageMaker, EC2, ECS and EKS.

We take an example of building a ***MXNet GPU python3 training*** container.

* Ensure you have access to an AWS account i.e. [setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) 
your environment such that awscli can access your account via either an IAM user or an IAM role. We recommend an IAM role for use with AWS. 
For the purposes of testing in your personal account, the following managed permissions should suffice: <br>
-- [AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess) <br>
-- [AmazonEC2FullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess) <br>
-- [AmazonEKSClusterPolicy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKSClusterPolicy) <br>
-- [AmazonEKSServicePolicy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKSServicePolicy) <br>
-- [AmazonEKSServiceRolePolicy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKSServiceRolePolicy) <br>
-- [AWSServiceRoleForAmazonEKSNodegroup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSServiceRoleForAmazonEKSNodegroup) <br>
-- [AmazonSageMakerFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSageMakerFullAccess) <br>
-- [AmazonS3FullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess) <br>
* [Create](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/create-repository.html) an ECR repository with the name “beta-mxnet-training” in the us-west-2 region
* Ensure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) client set-up on your system - osx/ec2

1. Clone the repo and set the following environment variables: 
    ``` 
    export ACCOUNT_ID=<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>
    export REGION=us-west-2
    export REPOSITORY_NAME=beta-mxnet-training
    ``` 
2. Login to ECR
    ```
    aws ecr get-login-password --region us-west-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
    ``` 
3. Assuming your working directory is the cloned repo, create a virtual environment to use the repo and install requirements
    ```
    python3 -m venv dlc
    source dlc/bin/activate
    pip install -r src/requirements.txt
    ``` 
4. Perform the initial setup
    ```
    bash src/setup.sh mxnet
    ```
### Building your image

The paths to the dockerfiles follow a specific pattern e.g., mxnet/training/docker/\<version>/\<python_version>/Dockerfile.<processor>

These paths are specified by the buildspec.yml residing in mxnet/buildspec.yml i.e. \<framework>/buildspec.yml. 
If you want to build the dockerfile for a particular version, or introduce a new version of the framework, re-create the 
folder structure as per above and modify the buildspec.yml file to specify the version of the dockerfile you want to build.

1. To build all the dockerfiles specified in the buildspec.yml locally, use the command
    ```
    python src/main.py --buildspec mxnet/buildspec.yml --framework mxnet
    ``` 
    The above step should take a while to complete the first time you run it since it will have to download all base layers 
    and create intermediate layers for the first time. 
    Subsequent runs should be much faster.
2. If you would instead like to build only a single image
    ```
    python src/main.py --buildspec mxnet/buildspec.yml \
                       --framework mxnet \
                       --image_types training \
                       --device_types cpu \
                       --py_versions py3
    ```
3. The arguments —image_types, —device_types and —py_versions are all comma separated list who’s possible values are as follows:
    ```
    --image_types <training/inference>
    --device_types <cpu/gpu>
    --py_versions <py2/py3>
    ```
4. For example, to build all gpu, training containers, you could use the following command
    ```
    python src/main.py --buildspec mxnet/buildspec.yml \
                       --framework mxnet \
                       --image_types training \
                       --device_types gpu \
                       --py_versions py3
    ```

### Upgrading the framework version
1. Suppose, if there is a new framework version for MXNet (version 1.7.0) then this would need to be changed in the 
buildspec.yml file for MXNet.
    ```
    # mxnet/buildspec.yml
      1   account_id: &ACCOUNT_ID <set-$ACCOUNT_ID-in-environment>
      2   region: &REGION <set-$REGION-in-environment>
      3   framework: &FRAMEWORK mxnet
      4   version: &VERSION 1.6.0 *<--- Change this to 1.7.0*
          ................
    ```
2. The dockerfile for this should exist at mxnet/docker/1.7.0/py3/Dockerfile.gpu. This path is dictated by the 
docker_file key for each repository. 
    ```
    # mxnet/buildspec.yml
     41   images:
     42     BuildMXNetCPUTrainPy3DockerImage:
     43       <<: *TRAINING_REPOSITORY
              ...................
     49       docker_file: !join [ docker/, *VERSION, /, *DOCKER_PYTHON_VERSION, /Dockerfile., *DEVICE_TYPE ]
     
    ```
3. Build the container as described above.
### Adding artifacts to your build context
1. If you are copying an artifact from your build context like this:
    ```
    # deep-learning-containers/mxnet/training/docker/1.6.0/py3
    COPY README-context.rst README.rst
    ```
    then README-context.rst needs to first be copied into the build context. You can do this by adding the artifact in 
    the framework buildspec file under the context key:
    ```
    # mxnet/buildspec.yml
     19 context:
     20   README.xyz: *<---- Object name (Can be anything)*
     21     source: README-context.rst *<--- Path for the file to be copied*
     22     target: README.rst *<--- Name for the object in** the build context*
    ```
2. Adding it under context makes it available to all images. If you need to make it available only for training or 
inference images, add it under training_context or inference_context.
    ```
     19   context:
        .................
     23       training_context: &TRAINING_CONTEXT
     24         README.xyz:
     25           source: README-context.rst
     26           target: README.rst
        ...............
    ```
3. If you need it for a single container add it under the context key for that particular image:
    ```
     41   images:
     42     BuildMXNetCPUTrainPy3DockerImage:
     43       <<: *TRAINING_REPOSITORY
              .......................
     50       context:
     51         <<: *TRAINING_CONTEXT
     52         README.xyz:
     53           source: README-context.rst
     54           target: README.rst
    ```
4. Build the container as described above.
### Adding a package
1. Suppose you want to add a package to the MXNet 1.6.0 py3 GPU docker image, then change the dockerfile from:
    ```
    # mxnet/training/docker/1.6.0/py3/Dockerfile.gpu
    139 RUN ${PIP} install --no-cache --upgrade \
    140     keras-mxnet==2.2.4.2 \
    ...........................
    159     ${MX_URL} \
    160     awscli
    ```
    to
    ```
    139 RUN ${PIP} install --no-cache --upgrade \
    140     keras-mxnet==2.2.4.2 \
    ...........................
    160     awscli \
    161     octopush
    ```
2. Build the container as described above.

### Running tests locally
As part of your iteration with your PR, sometimes it is helpful to run your tests locally to avoid using too many
extraneous resources or waiting for a build to complete. The testing is supported using pytest. 

Similar to building locally, to test locally, you’ll need access to a personal/team AWS account. To test out:

1. Either on an EC2 instance with the deep-learning-containers repo cloned, or on your local machine, make sure you have
the images you want to test locally (likely need to pull them from ECR)
2. In a shell, export environment variable DLC_IMAGES to be a space separated list of ECR uris to be tested. Also set 
CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION to some unique identifier that you can use to identify the resources your test spins up. 
Example:
[Note: change the repository name to the one setup in your account]
    ```
    export DLC_IMAGES="$ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pr-pytorch-training:training-gpu-py3 $ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pr-mxnet-training:training-gpu-py3"
    export CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION="my_unique_test"
    ```
3. Our pytest framework expects the root dir to be test/dlc_tests, so change directories in your shell to be here
    ```
    cd test/dlc_tests
    ```
4. To run all tests (in series) associated with your image for a given platform, use the following command
    ```
    # EC2
    pytest -s -rA ec2/ -n=auto
    # ECS
    pytest -s -rA ecs/ -n=auto
    
    #EKS
    export TEST_TYPE=eks
    python test/testrunner.py
    ```
    Remove `-n=auto` to run the tests sequentially.
5. To run a specific test file, provide the full path to the test file
    ```
    pytest -s ecs/mxnet/training/test_ecs_mxnet_training.py
    ```
6. To run a specific test function (in this example we use the cpu dgl ecs test), modify the command to look like so:
    ```
    pytest -s ecs/mxnet/training/test_ecs_mxnet_training.py::test_ecs_mxnet_training_dgl_cpu
    ```
