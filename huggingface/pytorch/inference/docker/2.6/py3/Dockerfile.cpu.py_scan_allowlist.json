    "79855": "Affected versions of the transformers package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to unbounded evaluation of user-supplied regular expressions in the AdamWeightDecay._do_use_weight_decay method. The TensorFlow optimizerâ€™s _do_use_weight_decay iterates over include_in_weight_decay and exclude_from_weight_decay lists and calls re.search on each pattern against parameter names, enabling catastrophic backtracking on crafted inputs. An attacker who can control these lists can provide pathological patterns that saturate the CPU and cause processes using transformers to hang, resulting in a Denial of Service."
