Commit fb6791d100d1b started exploiting this behavior to speed up filesystem unmount: gfs2 would simply free glocks it didn't want to unlock and then release the lockspace. This didn't take the bast callbacks for asynchronous lock contention notifications into account, which remain active until until a lock is unlocked or its lockspace is released. To prevent those callbacks from accessing deallocated objects, put the glocks that should not be unlocked on the sd_dead_glocks list, release the lockspace, and only then free those glocks. As an additional measure, ignore unexpected ast and bast callbacks if the receiving glock is dead.",

This didn't take the bast callbacks for asynchronous lock contention notifications into account, which remain active until until a lock is unlocked or its lockspace is released. To prevent those callbacks from accessing deallocated objects, put the glocks that should not be unlocked on the sd_dead_glocks list, release the lockspace, and only then free those glocks.

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nilfs2: add missing check for inode numbers on directory entries Syzbot reported that mounting and unmounting a specific pattern of corrupted nilfs2 filesystem images causes a use-after-free of metadata file inodes, which triggers a kernel bug in lru_add_fn(). As Jan Kara pointed out, this is because the link count of a metadata file gets corrupted to 0, and nilfs_evict_inode(), which is called from iput(), tries to delete that inode (ifile inode in this case). The inconsistency occurs because directories containing the inode numbers of these metadata files that should not be visible in the namespace are read without checking. Fix this issue by treating the inode numbers of these internal files as errors in the sanity check helper when reading directory folios/pages. Also thanks to Hillf Danton and Matthew Wilcox for their initial mm-layer analysis.",

Commit fb6791d100d1b started exploiting this behavior to speed up filesystem unmount: gfs2 would simply free glocks it didn't want to unlock and then release the lockspace. This didn't take the bast callbacks for asynchronous lock contention notifications into account, which remain active until until a lock is unlocked or its lockspace is released. To prevent those callbacks from accessing deallocated objects, put the glocks that should not be unlocked on the sd_dead_glocks list, release the lockspace, and only then free those glocks. As an additional measure, ignore unexpected ast and bast callbacks if the receiving glock is dead.",

As Jan Kara pointed out, this is because the link count of a metadata file gets corrupted to 0, and nilfs_evict_inode(), which is called from iput(), tries to delete that inode (ifile inode in this case). The inconsistency occurs because directories containing the inode numbers of these metadata files that should not be visible in the namespace are read without checking. Fix this issue by treating the inode numbers of these internal files as errors in the sanity check helper when reading directory folios/pages.
