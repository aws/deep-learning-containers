It looks up `stt` from tablefd, but then continues to use it after doing fdput() on the returned fd. After the fdput() the tablefd is free to be closed by another thread. The close calls kvm_spapr_tce_release() and then release_spapr_tce_table() (via call_rcu()) which frees `stt`. Although there are calls to rcu_read_lock() in kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group() they are not sufficient to prevent the UAF, because `stt` is used outside the locked regions. With an artifcial delay after the fdput() and a userspace program which triggers the race, KASAN detects the UAF: BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group+0x298/0x720 [kvm] Read of size 4 at addr c000200027552c30 by task kvm-vfio/2505 CPU: 54 PID: 2505 Comm: kvm-vfio Not tainted 6.10.0-rc3-next-20240612-dirty #1 Har",

Much later in the execve() code path, the file metadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how to set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the permissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges. For example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not set-id: ---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug 7 13:16 target to set-id and non-executable: ---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug 7 13:16 target it is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been disallowed. While this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been observed (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating the setuid bits of installed programs",

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf: Fix DEVMAP_HASH overflow check on 32-bit arches The devmap code allocates a number hash buckets equal to the next power of two of the max_entries value provided when creating the map. When rounding up to the next power of two, the 32-bit variable storing the number of buckets can overflow, and the code checks for overflow by checking if the truncated 32-bit value is equal to 0. However, on 32-bit arches the rounding up itself can overflow mid-way through, because it ends up doing a left-shift of 32 bits on an unsigned long value. If the size of an unsigned long is four bytes, this is undefined behaviour, so there is no guarantee that we'll end up with a nice and tidy 0-value at the end. Syzbot managed to turn this into a crash on arm32 by creating a DEVMAP_HASH with max_entries > 0x80000000 and then trying to update it. Fix this by moving the overflow check to before the rounding up operation.",
