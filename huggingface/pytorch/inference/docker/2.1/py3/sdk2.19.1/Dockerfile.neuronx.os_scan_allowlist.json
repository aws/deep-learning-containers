This appears to be intended to guard against the list chip->mdios being empty. However, it is not the correct check as the implementation of list_first_entry is not designed to return NULL for empty lists. Instead, use list_first_entry_or_null() which does return NULL if the list is empty. Flagged by Smatch. Compile tested only.",
