It looks up `stt` from tablefd, but then continues to use it after doing fdput() on the returned fd. After the fdput() the tablefd is free to be closed by another thread.

When rounding up to the next power of two, the 32-bit variable storing the number of buckets can overflow, and the code checks for overflow by checking if the truncated 32-bit value is equal to 0. However, on 32-bit arches the rounding up itself can overflow mid-way through, because it ends up doing a left-shift of 32 bits on an unsigned long value. If the size of an unsigned long is four bytes, this is undefined behaviour, so there is no guarantee that we'll end up with a nice and tidy 0-value at the end. Syzbot managed to turn this into a crash on arm32 by creating a DEVMAP_HASH with max_entries > 0x80000000 and then trying to update it. Fix this by moving the overflow check to before the rounding up operation.",

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: exec: Fix ToCToU between perm check and set-uid/gid usage When opening a file for exec via do_filp_open(), permission checking is done against the file's metadata at that moment, and on success, a file pointer is passed back. Much later in the execve() code path, the file metadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how to set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the permissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges. For example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not set-id: ---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug 7 13:16 target to set-id and non-executable: ---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug 7 13:16 target it is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been disallowed. While this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been observed (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating the setuid bits of installed programs",
