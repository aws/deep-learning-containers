Much later in the execve() code path, the file metadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how to set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the permissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges. For example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not set-id: ---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug 7 13:16 target to set-id and non-executable: ---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug 7 13:16 target it is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been disallowed.

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: bpf: Fix DEVMAP_HASH overflow check on 32-bit arches The devmap code allocates a number hash buckets equal to the next power of two of the max_entries value provided when creating the map. When rounding up to the next power of two, the 32-bit variable storing the number of buckets can overflow, and the code checks for overflow by checking if the truncated 32-bit value is equal to 0. However, on 32-bit arches the rounding up itself can overflow mid-way through, because it ends up doing a left-shift of 32 bits on an unsigned long value. If the size of an unsigned long is four bytes, this is undefined behaviour, so there is no guarantee that we'll end up with a nice and tidy 0-value at the end. Syzbot managed to turn this into a crash on arm32 by creating a DEVMAP_HASH with max_entries > 0x80000000 and then trying to update it. Fix this by moving the overflow check to before the rounding up operation.",

The dasd_ese_needs_format function checks for error codes that signal the non existence of a proper track format. The check for incorrect length is to imprecise since other error cases leading to transport of insufficient data also have this flag set. This might lead to data corruption in certain error cases for example during a storage server warmstart. Fix by removing the check for incorrect length and replacing by explicitly checking for invalid track format in transport mode.
