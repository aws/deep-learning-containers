# Security in {{ dlc_long }}

Cloud security at {{ aws }} is the highest priority. As an {{ aws }} customer, you benefit from a data center and network architecture that is built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations.

Security is a shared responsibility between {{ aws }} and you. The [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) describes this as security *of* the cloud and security *in* the cloud:

- **Security of the cloud** – {{ aws }} is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs {{ aws }} services in the {{ aws }} Cloud. {{ aws }} also provides you with services that you can use securely. Third-party auditors regularly test and verify the effectiveness of our security as part of the [{{ aws }} Compliance Programs](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/). To learn about the compliance programs that apply to {{ dlc }}, see [{{ aws }} Services in Scope by Compliance Program](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/).
- **Security in the cloud** – Your responsibility is determined by the {{ aws }} service that you use. You are also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your company's requirements, and applicable laws and regulations.

This documentation helps you understand how to apply the shared responsibility model when using {{ dlc }}. The following topics show you how to configure {{ dlc }} to meet your security and compliance objectives. You also learn how to use other {{ aws }} services that help you to monitor and secure your {{ dlc }} resources.
