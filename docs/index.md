# AWS Deep Learning Containers

AWS Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) are Docker images pre-installed with deep learning frameworks to make it easy to deploy custom machine learning environments quickly.

## Why Use Deep Learning Containers?

- **Pre-configured environments** - Optimized for AWS infrastructure
- **Consistent deployments** - Same container works across EC2, ECS, EKS, and SageMaker
- **Security patched** - Regular updates with security fixes
- **Multiple frameworks** - Support for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and more
