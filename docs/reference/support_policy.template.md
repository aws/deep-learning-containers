# Framework Support Policy

[AWS Deep Learning Containers](../index.md) simplify image configuration for deep learning workloads and are optimized with the latest frameworks, hardware, drivers, libraries, and operating systems. This page details the framework support policy for DLCs.
Refer to End of patch to check how long AWS supports current versions that are actively supported by the origin framework’s maintenance team. Frameworks and versions are available in single-framework DLCs.
