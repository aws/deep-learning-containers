# AWS Deep Learning Containers for PyTorch 2.6 ARM64 Inference on SageMaker

[AWS Deep Learning Containers](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/containers/) (DLCs) for Amazon SageMaker are now available for ARM64 platforms, including [AWS Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) instance types with support for PyTorch 2.6.

## Release Notes

- Introduced container for PyTorch 2.6.0 for inference supporting SageMaker services on ARM64 instances. For details about this release, check out our GitHub [release tag](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/releases/tag/v1.0-pt-arm64-sagemaker-2.6.0-inf-cpu-py312).
- Starting with PyTorch 2.6, we are removing Conda from the DLCs and installing all Python packages from PyPI.
- TorchServe version: 0.12.0

## Performance Improvements

These DLCs continue to deliver the best performance on Graviton for BERT and RoBERTa sentiment analysis and fill mask models.
