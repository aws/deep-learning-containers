# AWS Deep Learning Containers for PyTorch 2.5 ARM64 Inference on SageMaker

AWS Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) for Amazon SageMaker are now available for ARM64 platforms, including [AWS Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) instance types with support for PyTorch 2.5.

## Release Notes

- Introduced container for PyTorch 2.5.1 for inference supporting SageMaker services on ARM64 instances. For details about this release, check out our GitHub [release tag](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/releases/tag/v1.0-pt-arm64-sagemaker-2.5.1-inf-cpu-py311).
- Starting with PyTorch 2.5, we are changing the name of Graviton DLCs to ARM64 DLCs in order to generalize the usage.
- TorchServe version: 0.12.0

## Performance Improvements

These DLCs continue to deliver the best performance on Graviton for BERT and RoBERTa sentiment analysis and fill mask models.

## Security Advisory

AWS recommends that customers monitor critical security updates in the [AWS Security Bulletin](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/).
