# AWS Deep Learning Containers for PyTorch 2.5 Training on SageMaker

[AWS Deep Learning Containers](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/containers/) (DLCs) for Amazon SageMaker (SM) are now available with PyTorch
2.5 and support for CUDA 12.4 on Ubuntu 22.04.

This release includes container images for training on GPU, optimized for performance and scale on AWS. These Docker images have been tested with SM
service, and provide stable versions of NVIDIA CUDA, Intel MKL, and other components. All software components in these images are scanned for security
vulnerabilities and updated or patched in accordance with AWS Security best practices.

## Release Notes

- Introduced containers for PyTorch 2.5.1 for training which support SageMaker service. For details about this release, check out our GitHub
  [release tag](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/releases/tag/v1.0-pt-sagemaker-2.5.1-tr-py311).
- PyTorch 2.5 features a new CuDNN backend for SDPA, enabling speedups by default for users of SDPA on H100s or newer GPUs. Additionally, regional
  compilation of torch.compile offers a way to reduce the cold start up time for torch.compile by allowing users to compile a repeated nn.Module (e.g.
  a transformer layer in LLM) without recompilations. Finally, TorchInductor CPP backend offers solid performance speedup with numerous enhancements
  like FP16 support, CPP wrapper, AOT-Inductor mode, and max-autotune mode.
- Includes the fix for wheels from PyPI being unusable out-of-the-box on RPM-based Linux distributions, as addressed in PyTorch 2.5.1.
- Please refer to the official PyTorch 2.5.0 release notes [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/releases/tag/v2.5.0) and PyTorch 2.5.1 release
  notes [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/releases/tag/v2.5.1) for the full description of updates.
- NVIDIA/apex has been removed in favor of native torch operations. For more information on migrating from apex to torch built-in operations, see
  [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex).

## Security Advisory

AWS recommends that customers monitor critical security updates in the [AWS Security Bulletin](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/).

## Python 3.11 Support

Python 3.11 is supported in the PyTorch Training and Inference containers.

## CPU Instance Type Support

The containers support x86_64 instance types.

## GPU Instance Type Support

The containers support GPU instance types and contain the following software components for GPU support:

- CUDA 12.4.1
- cuDNN 9.1.0.70+cuda12.4
- NCCL 2.23.4+cuda12.4

## Build and Test

- Built on: c5.18xlarge
- Tested on: g3.16xlarge, p3.16xlarge, p3dn.24xlarge, p4d.24xlarge, p4de.24xlarge, g4dn.xlarge, p5.48xlarge
- Tested with Resnet50, BERT along with ImageNet datasets on EC2, ECS AMI (Amazon Linux AMI 2.0.20240515), and EKS AMI
  (amazon-eks-gpu-node-1.25.16-20240514)

## Known Issues

- Customers using [TransformerEngine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine) may run into
  `[W init.cpp:767] Warning: nvfuser is no longer supported in torch script, use _jit_set_nvfuser_enabled is deprecated and a no-op (function operator())`
  due to [NVFuser deprecation](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/commit/e6b5e0ecc609c15bfee5b383fe5c55fbdfda68ff) since PyTorch 2.2. For more
  information, please check this [issue](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine/issues/666).
