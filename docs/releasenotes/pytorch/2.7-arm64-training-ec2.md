# AWS Deep Learning Containers for PyTorch 2.7 ARM64 Training on EC2

[AWS Deep Learning Containers](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/containers/) (DLCs) for Amazon EC2 are now available for ARM64 platforms, including [AWS Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) instance types, with support for PyTorch 2.7 and CUDA 12.8 on Ubuntu 22.04.

## Release Notes

- Introduced containers for PyTorch 2.7 for Training on EC2. For details about this release, check out our GitHub [release tag](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/releases/tag/v1.0-pt-arm64-ec2-2.7.0-tr-gpu-py312).
- This image should be used with the [G5g instance type](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g5g/), which is powered by Graviton CPUs and NVIDIA T4G Tensor Core GPUs.
- This image includes: CUDA 12.8.0, cuDNN 9.8.0.87, NCCL 2.27.5, EFA installer 1.42.0, Transformer Engine 2.0, Flash Attention 2.7.3, GDRCopy 2.5
- Please note that EFA, Transformer Engine, Flash Attention, and GDRCopy have not been tested because of lack of hardware support.

## Security Advisory

AWS recommends that customers monitor critical security updates in the [AWS Security Bulletin](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/).

## GPU Instance Type Support

- CUDA 12.8
- cuDNN 9.8.0.87+cuda12.8
- NCCL 2.27.5+cuda12.8

## Known Issues

- There is no official [Triton](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton) distribution for ARM64/aarch64 yet.
- See [GitHub issue](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/153960): Passing device_id to torch.distributed.init_process_group() results in NCCL randomly hanging during communications.
