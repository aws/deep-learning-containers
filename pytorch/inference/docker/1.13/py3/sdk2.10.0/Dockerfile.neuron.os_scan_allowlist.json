Since this is not checked attackers passing values less than 4 can write outside of bounds of heap allocated objects and cause memory corruption.

However, this condition was not checked and an attacker could craft models that would result in infinite loop during evaluation. In certain cases, the infinite loop would be replaced by stack overflow due to too many recursive calls. For example, the `While` implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/106d8f4fb89335a2c52d7c895b7a7485465ca8d9/tensorflow/lite/kernels/while.cc) could be tricked into a scneario where both the body and the loop subgraphs are the same.

The `axis` argument can be `-1` (the default value for the optional argument) or any other positive value at most the number of dimensions of the input.
