  "70612": "In Jinja2, the from_string function is prone to Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) where it takes the \"source\" parameter as a template object, renders it, and then returns it. The attacker can exploit it with {{INJECTION COMMANDS}} in a URI. \r\nNOTE: The maintainer and multiple third parties believe that this vulnerability isn't valid because users shouldn't use untrusted templates without sandboxing.",
  "79077": "Affected versions of the h2 package are vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling due to improper validation of illegal characters in HTTP headers. The package allows CRLF characters to be injected into header names and values without proper sanitisation, which can cause request boundary manipulation when HTTP/2 requests are downgraded to HTTP/1.1 by downstream servers.",
  "78828": "Affected versions of the PyTorch package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to improper handling in the MKLDNN pooling implementation. The torch.mkldnn_max_pool2d function fails to properly validate input parameters, allowing crafted inputs to trigger resource exhaustion or crashes in the underlying MKLDNN library. An attacker with local access can exploit this vulnerability by passing specially crafted tensor dimensions or parameters to the max pooling function, causing the application to become unresponsive or crash.",
  "77744": "urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. Prior to 2.5.0, it is possible to disable redirects for all requests by instantiating a PoolManager and specifying retries in a way that disable redirects. By default, requests and botocore users are not affected. An application attempting to mitigate SSRF or open redirect vulnerabilities by disabling redirects at the PoolManager level will remain vulnerable. This issue has been patched in version 2.5.0."
