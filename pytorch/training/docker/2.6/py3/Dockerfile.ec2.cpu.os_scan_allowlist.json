      "description": "An out of bounds write exists in FreeType versions 2.13.0 and below when attempting to parse font subglyph structures related to TrueType GX and variable font files. The vulnerable code assigns a signed short value to an unsigned long and then adds a static value causing it to wrap around and allocate too small of a heap buffer. The code then writes up to 6 signed long integers out of bounds relative to this buffer. This may result in arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability may have been exploited in the wild.",

When using Jupyter Core prior to version 5.8.0 on Windows, the shared `%PROGRAMDATA%` directory is searched for configuration files (`SYSTEM_CONFIG_PATH` and `SYSTEM_JUPYTER_PATH`), which may allow users to create configuration files affecting other users. Only shared Windows systems with multiple users and unprotected `%PROGRAMDATA%` are affected. Users should upgrade to Jupyter Core version 5.8.0 or later to receive a patch. Some other mitigations are available. As administrator, modify the permissions on the `%PROGRAMDATA%` directory so it is not writable by unauthorized users; or as administrator, create the `%PROGRAMDATA%\\jupyter` directory with appropriately restrictive permissions; or as user or administrator, set the `%PROGRAMDATA%` environment variable to a directory with appropriately restrictive permissions (e.g. controlled by administrators _or_ the current user).",
