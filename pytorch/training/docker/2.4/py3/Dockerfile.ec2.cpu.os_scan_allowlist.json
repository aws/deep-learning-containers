      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: s390/dasd: fix error recovery leading to data corruption on ESE devices Extent Space Efficient (ESE) or thin provisioned volumes need to be formatted on demand during usual IO processing. The dasd_ese_needs_format function checks for error codes that signal the non existence of a proper track format. The check for incorrect length is to imprecise since other error cases leading to transport of insufficient data also have this flag set. This might lead to data corruption in certain error cases for example during a storage server warmstart. Fix by removing the check for incorrect length and replacing by explicitly checking for invalid track format in transport mode. Also remove the check for file protected since this is not a valid ESE handling case.",

Much later in the execve() code path, the file metadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how to set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the permissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges. For example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not set-id: ---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug 7 13:16 target to set-id and non-executable: ---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug 7 13:16 target it is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been disallowed.

To do so, it polls the config space of the first child device on the secondary bus. If that child device is concurrently removed, accesses to its struct pci_dev cause the kernel to oops. That's because pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() neglects to hold a reference on the child device. Before v6.3, the function was only called on resume from system sleep or on runtime resume. Holding a reference wasn't necessary back then because the pciehp IRQ thread could never run concurrently. (On resume from system sleep, IRQs are not enabled until after the resume_noirq phase.

To do so, it polls the config space of the first child device on the secondary bus. If that child device is concurrently removed, accesses to its struct pci_dev cause the kernel to oops. That's because pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() neglects to hold a reference on the child device. Before v6.3, the function was only called on resume from system sleep or on runtime resume. Holding a reference wasn't necessary back then because the pciehp IRQ thread could never run concurrently. (On resume from system sleep, IRQs are not enabled until after the resume_noirq phase.

The dasd_ese_needs_format function checks for error codes that signal the non existence of a proper track format. The check for incorrect length is to imprecise since other error cases leading to transport of insufficient data also have this flag set. This might lead to data corruption in certain error cases for example during a storage server warmstart. Fix by removing the check for incorrect length and replacing by explicitly checking for invalid track format in transport mode. Also remove the check for file protected since this is not a valid ESE handling case.",

Much later in the execve() code path, the file metadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how to set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the permissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges. For example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not set-id: ---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug 7 13:16 target to set-id and non-executable: ---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug 7 13:16 target it is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been disallowed.

This didn't take the bast callbacks for asynchronous lock contention notifications into account, which remain active until until a lock is unlocked or its lockspace is released. To prevent those callbacks from accessing deallocated objects, put the glocks that should not be unlocked on the sd_dead_glocks list, release the lockspace, and only then free those glocks.

As Jan Kara pointed out, this is because the link count of a metadata file gets corrupted to 0, and nilfs_evict_inode(), which is called from iput(), tries to delete that inode (ifile inode in this case). The inconsistency occurs because directories containing the inode numbers of these metadata files that should not be visible in the namespace are read without checking. Fix this issue by treating the inode numbers of these internal files as errors in the sanity check helper when reading directory folios/pages.

Details are described in each commit log. This patch (of 3): A use-after-free issue has been reported regarding the timer sc_timer on the nilfs_sc_info structure. The problem is that even though it is used to wake up a sleeping log writer thread, sc_timer is not shut down until the nilfs_sc_info structure is about to be freed, and is used regardless of the thread's lifetime. Fix this issue by limiting the use of sc_timer only while the log writer thread is alive.",

This happens because at btrfs_load_zone_info() we extract a device from the chunk map into a local variable and then use the device while not under the protection of the device replace rwsem. So if there's a device replace operation happening when we extract the device and that device is the source of the replace operation, we will trigger a use-after-free if before we finish using the device the replace operation finishes and frees the device. Fix this by enlarging the critical section under the protection of the device replace rwsem so that all uses of the device are done inside the critical section.",
