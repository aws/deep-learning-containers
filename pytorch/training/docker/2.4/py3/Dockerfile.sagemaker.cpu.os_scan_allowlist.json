As Jan Kara pointed out, this is because the link count of a metadata file gets corrupted to 0, and nilfs_evict_inode(), which is called from iput(), tries to delete that inode (ifile inode in this case). The inconsistency occurs because directories containing the inode numbers of these metadata files that should not be visible in the namespace are read without checking. Fix this issue by treating the inode numbers of these internal files as errors in the sanity check helper when reading directory folios/pages.

Details are described in each commit log. This patch (of 3): A use-after-free issue has been reported regarding the timer sc_timer on the nilfs_sc_info structure. The problem is that even though it is used to wake up a sleeping log writer thread, sc_timer is not shut down until the nilfs_sc_info structure is about to be freed, and is used regardless of the thread's lifetime.

This appears to be intended to guard against the list chip->mdios being empty. However, it is not the correct check as the implementation of list_first_entry is not designed to return NULL for empty lists. Instead, use list_first_entry_or_null() which does return NULL if the list is empty. Flagged by Smatch. Compile tested only.",

This happens because at btrfs_load_zone_info() we extract a device from the chunk map into a local variable and then use the device while not under the protection of the device replace rwsem. So if there's a device replace operation happening when we extract the device and that device is the source of the replace operation, we will trigger a use-after-free if before we finish using the device the replace operation finishes and frees the device. Fix this by enlarging the critical section under the protection of the device replace rwsem so that all uses of the device are done inside the critical section.",

Commit fb6791d100d1b started exploiting this behavior to speed up filesystem unmount: gfs2 would simply free glocks it didn't want to unlock and then release the lockspace. This didn't take the bast callbacks for asynchronous lock contention notifications into account, which remain active until until a lock is unlocked or its lockspace is released. To prevent those callbacks from accessing deallocated objects, put the glocks that should not be unlocked on the sd_dead_glocks list, release the lockspace, and only then free those glocks. As an additional measure, ignore unexpected ast and bast callbacks if the receiving glock is dead.",
