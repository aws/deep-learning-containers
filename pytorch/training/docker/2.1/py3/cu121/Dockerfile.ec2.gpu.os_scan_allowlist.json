This appears to be intended to guard against the list chip->mdios being empty.  However, it is not the correct check as the implementation of list_first_entry is not designed to return NULL for empty lists.  Instead, use list_first_entry_or_null() which does return NULL if the list is empty.  Flagged by Smatch. Compile tested only.",
