Likewise, applications\nthat use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()\nto check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.\nWhere the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from\nan untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nWhile DH_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817),\nDH_check_pub_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore\nvulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.\n\nLikewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an excessively large\nP, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q.\n\nAn application that calls DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and\nsupplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted sour",
