# Contributing Guidelines

We appreciate your interest in this project.\
At this time, **we are not accepting external contributions** (including pull requests or new feature submissions).

Our team is still in the early stages of establishing contribution workflows, code ownership, and testing standards.\
Once we are ready to open the project for community participation, we will announce it publicly and update this document with detailed contribution procedures.

In the meantime:

- You are welcome to **open issues** for **bug reports, questions, or feedback**.\
  Please keep issue reports focused and include relevant context (environment, version, steps to reproduce, etc.).
- Please **do not open pull requests** — they will be closed without review until contribution is re-enabled.
- Security issues should continue to be reported through the [AWS/Amazon Security vulnerability reporting page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/).
