    This method iterates through the apt packages to figure out packages that are impacted and upgradable and updates
    `patch_package_list` and `upgradable_packages_data_for_impacted_packages` with releavant data.

    The ECR Enhanced Scan gives the info about the source package that is impacted, but does not give the exact package/binary that is impacted.
    Hence, we need to find out the source of each package and see if the source or the package is impacted.
    If either is impacted and the package is upgradable, it is stored in the patch_package_list.

    For eg., in one of the ECR scans, the impacted packages was cups2. However, cups2 (https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/focal/cups)
    was not present in the DLC. Instead, the package present in DLC was one of its binaries called libcups2 (as can be seen in the link shared).
    Enhanced Scan does not point us to the exact impacted binary. Thus, for any package, we need to make sure if that package is directly reported
    by enhanced scan, or, if one of its soruce packages is being reported as impacted (cups2 was the source package for libcups2). In case a package
    or its source package is impacted, we make the decision to upgrade it.

    The patch_package_list consists of all the packages that need to be upgraded and their current version. It also updates a dictionary
    called upgradable_packages_data_for_impacted_packages. The purpose of upgradable_packages_data_for_impacted_packages dict is to
    store the patch data regarding each package. In other words, a key in this dict is the package name and the value for that key is
    a list. The list contains of all the packages that were upgraded because of this package being a source package. In case the package
    is not a source pacakge for any package, the list will only contain the name of the package.

    For eg, in case of libcups2 and cups2, in case libcups2 is present in the dlc, the dict would look like:
        {
            "cups2":["libcups2"],
            "libcups2":["libcups2"]
        }
    It can essentially interpreted as - "To patch `key` (cups2) packages in the `values` (["libcups2") had to be upgraded.
