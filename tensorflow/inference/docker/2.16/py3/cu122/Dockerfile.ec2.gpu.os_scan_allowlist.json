The description of cve is: A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq` global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or potential code execution. In aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial code is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in later tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the dev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb initial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into use-after-free because the net_device is freed. This patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), and added dev_p",

The will lead to deadlock if another process already owns that lock and tries to remove the interface, whether through a configuration change or because the device has been disconnected. As part of the removal procedure, device_del() waits for all ongoing sysfs attribute callbacks to complete. But usb_deauthorize_interface() can't complete until the device lock has been released, and the lock won't be released until the removal has finished. The mechanism provided by sysfs to prevent this kind of deadlock is to use the sysfs_break_active_protection() function, which tells sysfs not to wait for the attribute callback. Reported",

However, on 32-bit arches, the roundup code itself can overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shift of an unsigned long value, which is undefined behaviour, so it is not guaranteed to truncate neatly. This was triggered by syzbot on the DEVMAP_HASH type, which contains the same check, copied from the hashtab code. The commit in the fixes tag actually attempted to fix this, but the fix did not account for the UB, so the fix only works on CPUs where an overflow does result in a neat truncation to zero, which is not guaranteed. Checking the value before rounding does not have this problem.",
