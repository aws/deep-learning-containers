According to Documentation/admin-guide/mm/numaperf.rst: \"Some memory may share the same node as a CPU, and others are provided as memory only nodes.\" Therefore, some node CPU masks may be empty and wouldn't have a \"first CPU\". On a machine with far memory (and therefore CPU-less NUMA nodes): - cpumask_of_node(nid) is 0 - cpumask_first(0) is CONFIG_NR_CPUS - cpu_data(CONFIG_NR_CPUS) accesses the cpu_info per-CPU array at an index that is 1 out of bounds This does not have any security implications since flashing microcode is a privileged operation but I believe this has reliability implications by potentially corrupting memory while flashing a microcode update.
