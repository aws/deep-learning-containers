    "77740": "[Package: protobuf] Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to unbounded recursion when parsing untrusted Protocol Buffers data. The pure-Python implementation fails to enforce recursion depth limits when processing recursive groups, recursive messages, or a series of SGROUP tags, leading to stack overflow conditions that can crash the application by exceeding Python's recursion limit."
