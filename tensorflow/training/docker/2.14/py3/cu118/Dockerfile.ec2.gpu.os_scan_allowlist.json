However, on 32-bit arches, the roundup code itself can overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shift of an unsigned long value, which is undefined behaviour, so it is not guaranteed to truncate neatly. This was triggered by syzbot on the DEVMAP_HASH type, which contains the same check, copied from the hashtab code. So apply the same fix to hashtab, by moving the overflow check to before the roundup.",

The description of cve is: A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq` global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or potential code execution. In aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial code is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in later tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the dev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb initial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into use-after-free because the net_device is freed. This patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), and added dev_p",
