        "description": "## Overview\n[transformers](https://pypi.org/project/transformers) is a State-of-the-art Machine Learning for JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection via the `subprocess.Popen` calls. This could potentially allow for the execution of arbitrary code.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\nIt appears that while this issue is generally not critical for the library's primary use cases, it can become more significant in specific production environments. \r\nParticularly in scenarios where the library interacts with user-generated input, such as in web application backends, desktop applications, and cloud-based ML services, the risk of arbitrary code execution increases.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `transformers` to version 4.37.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [Additional Information](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.6/plugins/b602_subprocess_popen_with_shell_equals_true.html)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/commit/2272ab57a99bcac972b5252b87c31e24d0b25538)\n",
