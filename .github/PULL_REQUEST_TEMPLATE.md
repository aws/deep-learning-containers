- [ ] If the PR changes affects SM test, I've modified dlc_developer_config.toml in my PR branch by setting sagemaker_tests = true and efa_tests = true
- [ ] If this PR changes existing code, the change fully backward compatible with pre-existing code. (Non backward-compatible changes need special approval.)

- [ ] (If applicable) I've scanned the updated and new binaries to make sure they do not have vulnerabilities associated with them.

#### NEURON/GRAVITON Testing Checklist
* When creating a PR:
- [ ] I've modified `dlc_developer_config.toml` in my PR branch by setting `neuron_mode = true` or `graviton_mode = true`

#### Benchmark Testing Checklist
* When creating a PR:
- [ ] I've modified `dlc_developer_config.toml` in my PR branch by setting `ec2_benchmark_tests = true` or `sagemaker_benchmark_tests = true`

- [ ] (If applicable) I have added the marker `@pytest.mark.model("<model-type>")` to the new tests which I have added, to specify the Deep Learning model that is used in the test (use `"N/A"` if the test doesn't use a model)
- [ ] (If applicable) I have added the marker `@pytest.mark.integration("<feature-being-tested>")` to the new tests which I have added, to specify the feature that will be tested
- [ ] (If applicable) I have added the marker `@pytest.mark.multinode(<integer-num-nodes>)` to the new tests which I have added, to specify the number of nodes used on a multi-node test
- [ ] (If applicable) I have added the marker `@pytest.mark.processor(<"cpu"/"gpu"/"eia"/"neuron">)` to the new tests which I have added, if a test is specifically applicable to only one processor type
